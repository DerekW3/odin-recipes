        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> 
            This is a recipe for a classic italian-american chicken parmesan recipe.
            It is really delicious and my favorite food on earth. The savory pan-fried
            chicken and the fresh basil, mozzarella and sauce make it a well-rounded,
            delicious meal for you or your family.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> cooking spray </li>
            <li> 1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breasts </li>
            <li> 4 slices mozzarella cheese </li>
            <li> 2 cups tomato sauce, or to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li> 
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray.
                Place chicken on the prepared pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes.
                Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 more minutes.
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
